# Asteriod Defense Game [CSS 385]

This project was a collaboration between Jordy Ruiz & Henrie Filart. We created a game 
designed by UW students in the past as part of our 2-person project. Below is a link to
our game.<br>

## Objective:
Defend planet Earth from impending doom as multiple asteroids threaten all life! Blast them
from outer space before they can touch the base of Earth. You are provided a space ship
equiped with multiple cannons that shoot beams towards the asteroids, completely
incinerating them. Ensure you aren't destroyed in the process of defending planet
Earth from immediate threat. Good luck!
