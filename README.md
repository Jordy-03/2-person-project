# Asteriod Defense Game [CSS 385]

This project was a collaboration between Jordy Ruiz & Henrie Filart. We created a game 
designed by UW students in the past as part of our 2-person project. Below is a link to
the game.

## Objective:
Defend planet Earth from impending doom as multiple meteors threaten all life! Blast them
from outer space before they can touch the base of Earth.

## Controls:
