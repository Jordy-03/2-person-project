# Asteriod Defense Game [CSS 385]

This project was a collaboration between Jordy Ruiz & Henrie Filart. We created a game 
designed by UW students in the past as part of our 2-person project. Below is a link to
the game.<br>

equiped with multiple cannons that shoot beams towards the asteroids, completely
incinerating them. Good luck!
